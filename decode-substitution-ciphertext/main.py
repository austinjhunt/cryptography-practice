"""
Script for decrypting the contents of enc.txt encrypted with a substitution cipher.

The contents of enc.txt is a famous text that has been encoded using a substitution cipher.
As we've learned in class, a frequency analysis can be done of these types of texts to ascertain the key
- or something very near the key.

Tutorial on using / cracking substitution ciphers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhS8N6oJdno
(both caesar shifts and random substitutions)

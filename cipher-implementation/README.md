# Write or Implement a Cipher

Your cipher should both encrypt and decrypt a message. Your cipher may be one of your own construction or a common one of any strength you find on the Internet (from Caesar or Vigenere to FIP 140-2 ciphers such as AES).
You must include your code and sample runs including screenshots. If you implement a known cipher, it will have test inputs for verification and those should be used.
